#Notes:
1. CrewAI llm config for ollma withing agent file is 
get_llm = LLM(
    model="ollama/llama3.1",
    base_url="http://localhost:11434",   # Ollama's default URL
    api_key="ollama",                    # Trick: this is how you signal to litellm it's a local Ollama model
    # litellm_params={"api_base": "http://localhost:11434", "model": "llama3.1", "provider": "ollama"}
)
