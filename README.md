## 🧠 Project Overview

**AI Compliance Officer** is a production-ready tool that uses a multi-agent architecture to:
- Analyze uploaded company documents (PDFs, transcripts, etc.)
- Detect internal policy violations (e.g., data leaks, HR misconduct)
- Provide legal risk assessments
- Generate actionable suggestions (e.g., alert HR, revise language)

This project is built to demonstrate how intelligent agent collaboration, local LLMs, and scalable infrastructure can be combined to build secure, useful, and auditable AI workflows.
